## [Wave height forecasting for offshore access][waveheight]

Engineers need to periodically access offshore wind turbines to perform maintenance. This work developed a suite of wave height forecasters to predict whether waves will stay below the access limit, and an improved metric for assessing the strength of a forecaster.

## [Predicting remaining life of transformers][transformers]

Transformers are the most expensive components of power networks. This
research resulted in a probabilistic model for predicting remaining
transformer life, based on the ambient conditions it operates in. This can
be used to speculate about the effects of emergency overloading, as well as
predicting normal behaviour.

## [Defect diagnosis using deep neural nets][dnns]

Insulation is used in all electrical equipment to prevent short-circuit
faults. This work improved the accuracy of diagnosis of insulation defects
by using a deep approach, and led to insights about the features learned by
the deep network compared to typical engineered features.

## [Identifying harmonics from condition data][harmonics]

The data used to diagnose insulation defects can be distorted by harmonics
on the power network. This research proposed an alternative to expensive
harmonic monitoring, by diagnosing the presence of harmonics from the same
condition data. This gives a clearer picture of equipment health, by
separating harmonic effects from defect effects.
